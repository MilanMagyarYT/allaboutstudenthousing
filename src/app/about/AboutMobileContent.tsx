            Started helping students with finding housing in 2024, when we
            started posting Social Media interviews with students in Groningen.
            We spent all our free time offer free valuable tips and advice to
            hundreds of students every month.

            â€¢ The project started because of a very simple reason. As great
            friends, meeting in our first year of university, we have both lived
            terrible housing experiences in that year. Milan moved 5 times in
            the span of 10 months, moving from home to home, never knowing what
            will come next. On the other hand, Andrei had a terrible start to
            his journey, as he had to bear the costs of living in a hotel for
            the first month. In that time living of 5 euro salads to spear some
            money.

            build in the future our own application for finding housing more
            accessibly by students. Together with that aiming to help over 1000
            students find housing in 2025.
