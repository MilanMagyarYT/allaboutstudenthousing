            ‚Ä¢ {/* TODO: Replace */} We started our journey in the Netherlands as
            Computer Science students at the University of Groningen in 2022.
            From there, in the first month of our studies at one of our courses,
            we randomly met each other and started bonding because of a terribly
            difficult assignment that Andrei helped Milan with. From that day
            on, we have been inseperable, going through 3 beautiful years
            together.

          <Typography sx={{ color: "#222", lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            ‚Ä¢ {/* TODO: Replace */} The project started because of a very simple
            reason. As great friends, meeting in our first year of university,
            we have both lived terrible housing experiences in that year. Milan
            moved 5 times in the span of 10 months, moving from home to home,
            never knowing what will come next. On the other hand, Andrei had a
            terrible start to his journey, as he had to bear the costs of living
            in a hotel for the first month. In that time living of 5 euro salads
            to spear some money.

          <Typography sx={{ color: "#222", lineHeight: 1.6 }}>
            ‚Ä¢ {/* TODO: Replace */} The project first started in February 2024,
            from two ideas. Milan wanted to start a Social Media series doing
            interviews about the experiences of students in the Netherlands,
            while Andrei wanted to dive deeper into his craft, as a son of
            Architects, and planned to work more in the housing space.

            ‚Ä¢ {/* TODO: Replace */} After having an incredible Social Media
            growth, being able to capture authentic human experiences through
            our street interviews, we started helping hundreds of students on a
            monthly basis with the experience of searching for housing in the
            Netherlands offering free help. This turned into the opportunity of
            writing our first eBook teaching students how to find housing in
            under 30 days.

            aiming to help over 1000 students find housing in 2025.
